                   <p> Natural history is a domain of inquiry involving organisms, including animals, fungi, and plants, in their natural environment, leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study. A person who studies natural history is called a naturalist or natural historian.</p>

                <p>Few scholars think that history repeats itself, whereas other refutes this idea 
                    vehemently. The truth is that both these ideas are partly true. History repeats itself in the 
                    sense that things of the world are the same all the time but the ways are different every time. 
                    Although historical events do not occur in the same order and in the same place, they have a 
                    basic unity, and conform to a pattern which is easily discernible on closer study. Those who 
                    oppose view that change is the law of nature, and even if apparently two events seem alike, 
                    they are not really the same, for history is a record of unique, individualistic and remarkable 
                    events. If historical events are repeated, the problem of growth, development and progress 
                    would not arise. But the truth is that history neither repeats itself, nor is it totally free from the 
                    basic unity of all its facts. Change appears to be the basic character of history indicating that 
                    history does not repeat itself. </p>

                <p>Natural history can be defined as understanding plants, animals, and other organisms in the context of the habitats in which they occur. Historically, natural history was created and dominated by Europeans, who aimed to catalogue all living things, including humans, into ways that served European colonial interests.</p>
